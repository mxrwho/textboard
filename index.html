            <p>I was born a female.</p>

            <p>I was born a female, and thus declared <span class="clickable" data-sound="itsagirl">“girl”</span>.</p>

            <p>
                Of course, being a <span class="clickable" data-sound="girl">“girl”</span> came with its own set of desired
                characteristics: For pre-puberty those would be <span class="clickable" data-sound="lookhowcute">“cuteness”</span> and <span class="clickable" data-sound="sweet">“mildness”</span>.
            </p>

            <p>I was destined to fail in both.</p>

            <p>[...]</p>

            <p>
                At my parents’ dinner parties along with the dolls that came as gifts I was given questions: <span class="clickable" data-sound="children">“How many children are you going to have when you grow up?”</span>, <span class="clickable" data-sound="marry"> “Who are you going to marry?”</span>.
            </p>

            <p>[...]</p>

            <p>But when I wasn’t creating worlds of adventure or sorrow in my room, I played outside:</p>

            <p>
                I can’t forgive the class bias for making <span class="clickable" data-sound="dirty">“dirty”</span> such a negative word. There, in the dirt, I played hide and seek, tag, dodgeball, but most of all I played football with the boys, I fought with the boys, I explored empty buildings and climbed fig trees with the boys. In my mind I was one of them, whatever that was.
            </p>

            <p>I was proclaimed a <span class="clickable" data-sound="tomboy">“tomboy”</span>.</p>

            <p>
                I was strong-willed, resolute, talkative and loud. On good days those characteristics would make me a 
                <span class="clickable" data-sound="aleader">“leader”</span> but on bad days and since all I could actually lead was my shiny army of marbles, they just made me <span class="clickable" data-sound="yourestubborn">“stubborn”</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                And since adjectives have their own clusters and spectrums, and despite its seeming innocence, <span class="clickable" data-sound="stubborn">“stubborn”</span> often came along with <span class="clickable" data-sound="controversial">“controversial”</span>, <span class="clickable" data-sound="naysayer">“naysayer”</span> and <span class="clickable" data-sound="quarrelsome">“quarrelsome”</span>.
            </p>

            <p>And being a <span class="clickable" data-sound="stubborn_tomboy">“stubborn_tomboy”</span> has an expiration date.</p>

            <p>[…]</p>

            <p>
                I got my first period when I was ten. At the time such an event was explicitly phrased as <span class="clickable" data-sound="woman">“becoming a woman”</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/textboard1.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                I was corrected because I walked <span class="clickable" data-sound="boywalk">“like a boy”</span> and was strongly urged to take ballet classes in order to become <span class="clickable" data-sound="graceful">“graceful”</span>.
            </p>

            <p>My changing body became a source of shame and a hindrance, instead of a source of pride and joy.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/textboard2.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                As girls grew, expectations extended to being <span class="clickable" data-sound="modest">“modest”</span>, <span class="clickable" data-sound="prudent">“prudent”</span> and <span class="clickable" data-sound="quiet">“quiet”</span>. Hanging out with the boys, and especially with the <span class="clickable" data-sound="bad">“bad”</span> boys, was enough to set off a general alarm and to label me <span class="clickable" data-sound="wild">“wild”</span>.
            </p>

            <p>[...]</p>

            <p>Eventually I understood that for my friends too I was a <span class="clickable" data-sound="girl2">“girl”</span>.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/textboard3.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                I was <span class="clickable" data-sound="different">“different”</span> and the defenses I built during my teenage years were meant to make me <span class="clickable" data-sound="tough">“tough”</span> and <span class="clickable" data-sound="strong">“strong”</span>.
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/textboard4.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                I was morphing into something <span class="clickable" data-sound="weird">“weird”</span> and everything that made <span class="clickable" data-sound="strange">“strange”</span> a good thing filled me with comfort and, along with the <span class="clickable" data-sound="misfits">“misfits”</span> who accepted me, offered a sense of community and belonging.
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/textboard5.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                And although the <span class="clickable" data-sound="wholeness">“wholeness”</span> of a core self is a construct and nothing in us remains unmovable
            </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/textboard6.png">
            </div>

            <p>I had to make a new self, with new vocabulary:</p>

            <p>A frame</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="clickable" data-sound="worthy">“worthy”</span></p>

            <p>a house</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="clickable" data-sound="beautiful">“beautiful”</span></p>

            <p>a room</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="clickable" data-sound="warm">“warm”</span></p>

            <p>where I could feel</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="clickable" data-sound="capable">“capable”</span></p>

            <p>comfortable and safe</p>
                        
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to exist</p>

            <p>allowed to be and to become</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="clickable" data-sound="lovable">“lovable”</span>

            <p>and try and fail and try.</p>
